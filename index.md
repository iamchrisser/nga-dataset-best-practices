title: Information Management for the NGA LTER Site
exclude: true
---

These pages host information management resources for the NGA LTER site. These resources will be the canonical guides to site data formatting, curation, and archiving, and to the underlying processes and systems. At the moment, these pages describe our pretty good practices for dataset preparation and the IM approach. This set of resources will grow over the life of the site. 

### The Resources

#### 1. [Pretty Good Practices for NGA LTER Datasets v1.0](/resources/nga-dataset-best-practices.md)
#### 2. [The NGA LTER IM Handbook](/resources/nga-im-handbook.md)
